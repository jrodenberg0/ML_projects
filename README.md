This project was using a mineral hardness dataset on Kaggle. I learned alot of different feature engineering techniques, namely using statistical transformers like logarithms and boxcox, I also picked up a better understanding of univariate feature selection. 

I ended up building an ensemble regressor (this was more so to understand how ensemble regressors in SKlearn work) and achieved a median absolute error of .55. 

I completed this project around 3-4 months ago and it is humbling to see how much I have progressed looking back at this notebook, but still thought I would post!!!!
